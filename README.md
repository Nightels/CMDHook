## Do you know 'Rubber Ducky'?

If no, the Rubber Ducky has a pendrive shape, and looks like a normal pendrive. But, you can upload scripts to this stuff,
and when the victim plugs it to his computer, the script starts running it on.

## This software turns a normal pendrive into a 'Rubber Ducky'
When you download this software, you need to select scripts, and set it up these.
E.g: Wifi informations script -> Save specified wifi password. 

Then select a save method:
- Save to computer
- Save to pendrive or storage media
- Save to FTP
- Send in email

## How does it works?

This panel shows up in start. Here you can see a small usage manual.

Then select a script and if after there is a 'Settings' icon, click on it.
This script gets the WIFI_DUCKY network password (if connected before) and saves it to a log file.

And the finish, select save method. I was selected 'Save to computer' and typed location where I want to save the file.
How its works? When the cmd.exe starts the script, after every command, saves it to a log file in the exe dictionary.
When the last script ran, the cmd copy the log file into the dictionary which I typed, and delete temporary file from exe dictionary.

## Important: 
Its a pre-release, just only the 'Save to computer' save method works. 
Just use in you computer.
